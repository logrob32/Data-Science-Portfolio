# Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I've got a few projects in here meant to demonstrate some of the skills I have. For the most part, these aren't particularly well annotated, as the focus is more on showing the skillset I have, not on collaborating with anyone else. Here's a breakdown of what each project shows:


EPL Win Loss Predictions Edited.ipynb - A project focusing on predicting English Premier League matches. It primarily demonstrates web scraping and machine learning models.

NFL Draft.ipynb - This one is focused on improving performance in the NFL Draft. It primarily demonstrates web scraping, data visualization, and data analysis.

DATAQUEST PROJECTS (Marked DQ) - These are smaller projects I completed while completing my certificate on Dataquest. They are designed to showcase a specific skill.

[DQ] [Data Cleaning] Star Wars Survey.ipynb - As in the name, this one focuses mostly on data cleaning. It's a relatively messy dataset, and shows me creating loops and functions that make parsing the data easier.

[DQ][SQL] Answering Business Questions Using SQL.ipynb - This focuses on SQL and shows some slightly more complex SQL querries.

[DQ][DT] Predicting Bike Rentals.ipynb - Mostly focused on using Decision Trees and Random Forests models.

[DQ][ML] Titanic.ipynb - This is perhaps the most overused dataset of all time, but I used it to show off some machine learning skills, particularly using grid search to find the best model and to optimize parameters.
